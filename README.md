* The website was tested continously during the development process as each new piece of code was written. 

### Further Testing
* The website was tested on Google Chrome.
* The website was viewed on a variety of device sizes such as Desktop, Samsung S10 and Samsung tablet, I used the responsive function when inspecting the pages to view various sizes. 
* All links were tested multiple times during the development process to ensure that all pages were linked correctly.
* Family members were asked to view the site and point out any bugs.

### Known Bugs
* There are two errors on the gallery.html and survery.html - I chose not to add headings to these sections as I felt the look of the page did not require any headings.
