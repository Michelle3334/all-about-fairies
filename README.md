# Testing
## Functionality Testing

* All links were tested multiple times during the development process to ensure that all pages were linked correctly.
* Family members were asked to view the site and point out any bugs.

## Code Validation
* The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

## Compatibility Testing
* The website was tested on Google Chrome.
* The website was viewed on a variety of device sizes such as Desktop, Samsung S10 and Samsung tablet, I used the responsive function when inspecting the pages to view various sizes. 

## Performance testing
I ran the Lighthouse tool to check performance of the website. There were two issues that I had to correct. I had omitted the meta name description and the link to the survey page was not good SEO. Screenshots of the final test are presented below:
