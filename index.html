            <h2>What are Fairies?</h2>
            <p>A fairy is a type of mythical being or legendary creature found in the folklore of many European cultures (including Celtic, Slavic, German, English, and French folklore). It is a form of spirit, often described as metaphysical, supernatural, or preternatural.</p>
            <p>The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific magical creatures with human appearance, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery. At other times it has been used to describe any magical creature, such as goblins and gnomes. Fairy has at times been used as an adjective, with a meaning equivalent to "enchanted" or "magical". It is also used as a name for the place these beings come from, the land of Fairy.</p>

            <h2>History of Fairies</h2>
            <p>Historical origins include various traditions of Brythonic (Bretons, Welsh, Cornish), Gaelic (Irish, Scots, Manx), and Germanic peoples, and of Middle French medieval romances. Fairie was used adjectivally, meaning "enchanted" (as in fairie knight, fairie queene), but also became a generic term for various "enchanted" creatures during the Late Middle English period. Literature of the Elizabethan era combined elves with the fairies of Romance culture, rendering these terms somewhat interchangeable.</p>
            <p>Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single origin, but are rather a collection of folk beliefs from disparate sources. Various folk theories about the origins of fairies include casting them as either demoted angels or demons in a Christian tradition, as deities in Pagan belief systems, as spirits of the dead, as prehistoric precursors to humans, or as spirits of nature.</p>
