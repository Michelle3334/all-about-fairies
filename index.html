            <h2>What are Fairies?</h2>
            <p>A fairy is a type of mythical being or legendary creature found in the folklore of many European cultures (including Celtic, Slavic, German, English, and French folklore). It is a form of spirit, often described as metaphysical, supernatural, or preternatural.</p>
            <p>The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific magical creatures with human appearance, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery. At other times it has been used to describe any magical creature, such as goblins and gnomes. Fairy has at times been used as an adjective, with a meaning equivalent to "enchanted" or "magical". It is also used as a name for the place these beings come from, the land of Fairy.</p>
